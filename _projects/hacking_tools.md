A suite of hacking tools focused on MITM (Man in the middle) attacks. The following tools are included: ARP Spoofing, MAC address Changer, Network Scanner, and Sniffer. These tools allow users to place themselves in between the target machine and the gateway, tricking the victim into thinking that the hacker machine is the gateway, thus sending all its network traffic to the hacker machine. The hacker machine can then capture all the traffic for analysis later. All the tools are written in Python and Scapy module. More tools will be added, such as DNS Spoofing and HTTPS bypass, etc.

During my last co-op term, I had the chance to study all about networking and have since developed an interest in networking and security. That's why I started working on this project, several small scripts that are intended to exploit network vulnerabilities. This also leads me to my current co-op position, software developer in test for MACsec feature, where I develop automated scripts to test and attempt to break this security feature. 

I am looking to add more attacks to this suite, including but not limited to MITM attacks.
