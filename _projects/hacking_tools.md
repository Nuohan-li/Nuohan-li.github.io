Introducing a suite of hacking tools focused on MITM (Man in the Middle) attacks. The suite includes the following tools: ARP Spoofing, MAC Address Changer, Network Scanner, and Sniffer. These tools enable users to position themselves between the target machine and the gateway, deceiving the victim into believing that the hacker's machine is the gateway. Consequently, all network traffic from the victim is redirected to the hacker's machine. The hacker machine can then capture and analyze the intercepted traffic. All the tools are developed using Python and the Scapy module. Future additions to the suite will include tools like DNS Spoofing and HTTPS bypass, among others.

Currently, I am working on enhancing the program by creating a main page that functions as a terminal program. This will facilitate the execution of individual scripts through command-like inputs.

Furthermore, more features are in the pipeline, such as DoS attacks, Bluetooth scanning, and packet crafting.

*** Stay tuned for an upcoming showcase, where each available feature will be demonstrated.
