A suite of hacking tools focused on MITM (Man in the middle) attacks. The following tools are included: ARP Spoofing, MAC address Changer, Network Scanner, and Sniffer. These tools allow users to place themselves in between the target machine and the gateway, tricking the victim into thinking that the hacker machine is the gateway, thus sending all its network traffic to the hacker machine. The hacker machine can then capture all the traffic for analysis later. All the tools are written in Python and Scapy module. More tools will be added, such as DNS Spoofing and HTTPS bypass, etc.

I am currently working on making it a more complete program, building a main page that works like a terminal program to handle all the individual scripts, so that they could be executed like a command we type in a terminal.

More features will also be added, such as DoS attack, bluetooth scanner, packet crafter etc. 


*** showcase of each available features coming soon...s
