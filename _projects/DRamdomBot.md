*** The bot does not work and needs to be reimplemented ***


DRandomBot is a discord bot built with discord.py and Python. It is capable of doing many things, such as getting a random dad joke, cat pictures, or even coordinating players to play a tictactoe game, etc. A list of commands can be found on my GitHub page.

This was absolutely a fun project to work on as it made my discord server a lot more lively, as it allowed my friends to engage with each other easily in the server.
Thanks to this little bot, I learned many new modules in Python that helped with the next major project I worked on with my friend.

While I had a lot of fun making this bot, it is unfortunately no longer functional as discord.py, the library that made this possible, has been taken down by its owner due to the frustration of inconsistency and bureaucracy that he had to deal with when communicating with discord employees. He has become Here is a link to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1"> post made by Danny</a> made by Danny, the author of discord.py, explaining why he has decided to shut down the project.

Fast forward six months and the author has decided to resume this project, as he feels that other modules to make the bot are not really up to par, see his post <a href="https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/c4324f17a80c94776832430007ad40e6">here</a>.

Even though for now, the bot is no longer working, I would like to eventually migrate it to discord.js using JavaScript, as it seems that there is less “drama” over there, thus ensuring greater stability with my bot.
