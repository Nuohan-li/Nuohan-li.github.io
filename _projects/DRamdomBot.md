*** The bot does not work and needs to be reimplemented ***

DRandomBot is a Discord bot developed using discord.py and Python. It offers a wide range of functionalities, including fetching random dad jokes, cat pictures, and even organizing players for a game of tic-tac-toe, among other things. You can find a comprehensive list of commands on my GitHub page.

Creating this bot was an incredibly enjoyable project, as it brought a lot of liveliness to my Discord server and made it easier for my friends to interact with each other. Thanks to this little bot, I also had the opportunity to learn new Python modules that proved useful for my subsequent major project with a friend.

Note 1: Unfortunately, discord.py is discontinued by its owner. The library was taken down because the owner, Danny, had to contend with frustration, inconsistency, and bureaucracy while communicating with Discord employees. You can read Danny's post about this decision  <a href="https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1"> here</a> .

Note 2: In a surprising turn of events, the author has recently decided to resume the project. Danny believes that other modules available for creating bots do not meet the same standards. You can read his post on this matter <a href="https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/c4324f17a80c94776832430007ad40e6">here</a>.

**The bot is currently inactive, I plan to eventually migrate it to discord.js using JavaScript. It appears that the JavaScript ecosystem has less "drama," which would ensure greater stability for my bot in the long run.
