It is the my very first emulator project. I wanted to make a gameboy emulator, as I have always been a Nintendo fan, as I look through gameboy's technical documentation, I realized how little I know about computer hardware, that is why I decided to go with an easier project, the CHIP8 emulator, to get myself familiarized with emulator and computer hardware before finally getting to work on gameboy emulator. 

Luckily CHIP8 has a very easy and beginner friendly <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM"> technical reference</a>, listed on Frédéric Devernay's website.

This has proven to be one of the more involved projects I have taken on by myself. It is the first time I got exposed to CPU instructions as I have to emulate the opcodes' functionality.s

While my program is mostly done, it still contains some bugs, still in process of debugging my opcodes...
