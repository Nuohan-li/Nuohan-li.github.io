This is my very first emulator project, and I initially wanted to create a Gameboy emulator since I've always been a Nintendo fan. However, as I delved into the technical documentation of the Gameboy, I realized how little I knew about computer hardware. This realization led me to choose a more manageable project, the CHIP8 emulator, in order to familiarize myself with emulators and computer hardware before eventually tackling the Gameboy emulator.

Fortunately, the CHIP8 emulator had a very user-friendly technical reference available on Frédéric Devernay's website. You can find it <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM"> here</a>.

Developing the CHIP8 emulator has proven to be one of the most challenging projects I have undertaken on my own. It introduced me to CPU instructions for the first time, as I had to emulate the functionality of the opcodes. I will write some more about this in my blog.

While my program is mostly complete, it still contains some bugs. I'm currently in the process of debugging the opcodes...
