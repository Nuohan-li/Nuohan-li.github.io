Hi! My name is Nuohan Li, currently a second year student at the University of Waterloo in Computer Engineering. Currently on co-op term,
working as a software developer in test for Nokia Canada. My main responsibility is to develop new automated test scripts to test MACsec
feature of Nokia's routers and contribute to the existing testing framework, with occasional opportunity to work on packet crafting.

I write programs in C/C++, Python, Java/JavaFX, JavaScript and Tcl and program FPGA devices in VHDL. When I am not working, I am usually found in my room learning some new stuff: physics, astronomy, networking, security/ethical hacking, embedded software etc. Or playing video games and watching cat videos on YouTube. 

For the past 10 years, I lived in the beautiful city of Montreal, where I learned both languages of Canada, made friends, discovered my interests, went through my adolescence. It is a unique city with its own distinct culture where the English and French and a myriad of cultures from around the world meet and blend. As much as I love this city, I still decided to leave and start the new chapter of my life. 

Now that I have to move every four months for co-op terms, I also find myself enjoying exploring the city.
