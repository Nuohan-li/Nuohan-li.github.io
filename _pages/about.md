Hi! My name is Nuohan Li, and I'm currently a second-year student at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Electrical Engineering. I'm currently on a co-op term, working as a software developer for Nokia Canada in the deep packet inspection team. My main responsibility, as the job title implies, is to write code! Most of my work revolves around cryptography and digital signatures, which includes implementing different cipher suites such as ChaCha20-Poly1305.

I have experience writing programs in C/C++, Python, Java/JavaFX, JavaScript, Tcl, and programming FPGA devices in VHDL. When I'm not working, you can usually find me in my room, eagerly learning new things such as physics, astronomy, networking, security/ethical hacking, and embedded software. Of course, I also enjoy relaxing by playing video games and watching cat videos on YouTube.

For the past 10 years, I have lived in the beautiful city of Montreal, where I have had the opportunity to learn both of Canada's official languages, make friends, discover my interests, find my first job, and go through my adolescence. Montreal is a unique city with its own distinct culture, where English and French intertwine and various cultures from around the world converge and blend. Although I love this city dearly, I made the decision to leave and embark on a new chapter of my life.

<!-- Now that I have to move every four months for co-op terms, I also find myself enjoying exploring the city. -->
