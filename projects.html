Here is a showcase of some projects I have worked on, both completed and ongoing. Although I primarily worked alone on these projects,
 I have also had the privilege of collaborating with talented individuals during my academic journey to bring some of these ideas 
 to fruition. For more information about my work, you can explore all of my projects <a href="/projects/all-projects/">here</a>.
